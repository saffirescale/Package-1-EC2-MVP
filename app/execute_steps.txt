Here are the next steps to run your Flask app with a Postgres database using Docker Compose:

Open a terminal and navigate to your app directory:
cd d:\6_GITHUB\Pulumi\pulumi-start-aws\app

===>>>  WSL   (to start wsl ubuntu instance)

Build and start both containers (Flask app and Postgres) with Docker Compose:
docker-compose up --build           # build and up both

##==========================================================================
# IMPORTANT: To update the app without losing database data:
# 1. Stop the containers (this does NOT remove volumes or data):
docker-compose down
# 2. Update your app code as needed.
# 3. Rebuild the web image (no need to remove volumes):
docker-compose build web
# 4. Start the containers again:
docker-compose up
#
# DO NOT use '--volumes' or '--rmi all' if you want to keep your database data.
# The 'pgdata' volume preserves your Postgres data between runs.
##==========================================================================

docker-compose down   
         ##flags  --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans  #  Remove everything & DATA LOST
docker-compose build --no-cache     # recreate from scratch as no-cache
docker-compose up

docker ps    -a
docker images
docker-compose logs web
docker logs app_web_1

Wait for both containers to start. The Flask app will automatically create the database table on first request.
Connect to the Postgres container & check data in PG ::
   docker exec -it app_db_1 psql -U postgres -d userdb
   SELECT * FROM "user";

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080
You should see the web form. Fill it out and submit. Each submission is saved in the Postgres database.
